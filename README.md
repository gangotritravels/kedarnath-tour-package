Nestled in the lap of the Garhwal Himalayas, Kedarnath is one of the most revered pilgrimage sites in India. The town is home to the sacred Kedarnath Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, and is part of the Char Dham Yatra. The temple’s origins date back to the Mahabharata era, believed to have been established by the Pandavas. It was later revived by the 8th-century saint Adi Shankaracharya. Set against the dramatic backdrop of snow-capped peaks, Kedarnath offers a profound spiritual experience that attracts devotees and nature enthusiasts alike.
